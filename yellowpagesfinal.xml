 <!--above lines are the tricky part. html-to-xml process in web harvest converts                                                                                                                                                                                      ^here is the variable which when changed gives you the next pages                              
 the html to xml so that we can use xpath to get the data out.
 http process gets the html response from the given url.                                                                                                                                                                                                               here as in each loop z changes so does the link and thus we get newer pages.                                                                      
 The url should be well formed that is & should be replaced with &amp; and similar special http/xml symbols should be replaced.
  Most yellow pages kind of sites have a next page result link, sometimes it is easy to get the link by just right clicking and 
  clicking inspect element or opening in new tab.Sometimes this doesn't work because the next page button starts to execute a javascript.
  In such a case we need to find out what link the javascript is using to get the data from the server, this can be done by 
  google chrome. Before clicking on next page link, right click in a blank space and then click inspect element from the right click menu.
  Now click on networks tab below the page. Now when you click next page result you can find out the link through which the javascript is getting 
  newer results. In this link there will be variable which when changed generates the link for the the next pages.-->
